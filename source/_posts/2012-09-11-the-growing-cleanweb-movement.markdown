There is a movement growing. Bit by bit, developers are using the power of the web to make our world more sustainable. Whether by improving the way we travel, the way we eat, or the way we use energy, the web is making a difference. The [Cleanweb](http://cleanweb.co) movement is building a global conversation, with local chapters running hackdays and meetups to get people together all over the world.

Here in the UK, we've been doing this longer than anyone else. Cleanweb-style projects were emerging in 2007, with 2008's [geeKyoto](https://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/geekyoto-aftermath/) conference bringing together a lot of early efforts. 

It's only really appropriate then that we have the most active Cleanweb community in the world, in the form of [Cleanweb London](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London). With over 150 members, it's a great base, on which we're building a wider [Cleanweb UK](http://cleanweb.org.uk) movement. We've run a [hackday](http://london.greenhackathon.com), have regular meetups, and are building towards our first [Ignite Cleanweb](http://cleanweb.org.uk/ignite.html) evening in a couple of days' time.

This is an expanding community, made of many different projects and groups, and one that has a chance to do some real good. If you'd like to be part of it, or if you already are but didn't know it, come along to a [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London) and get involved!
