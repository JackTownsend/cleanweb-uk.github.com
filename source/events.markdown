Cleanweb London
-------

We have a very active London meetup group; it's probably the biggest Cleanweb group in the world, with nearly 200 members. We meet regularly for pub discussions and slightly more formal talk nights. We recently ran [Ignite Cleanweb](/ignite.html), a massively successful lightning talk evening. If you want a flavour, go watch the videos.
