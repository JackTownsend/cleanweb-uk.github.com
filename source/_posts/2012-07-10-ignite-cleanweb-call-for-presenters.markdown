[Cleanweb UK](http://www.cleanweb.org.uk/) are excited to announce our first [Ignite](http://igniteshow.com/) evening in London, hosted by [Forward Technology](http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/venue) on **Thursday 13th September 2012**.

[Ignite](http://igniteshow.com/) is a geek event that has been held in over 100 cities worldwide. At the events, Ignite presenters share their personal and professional passions, using 20 slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds for a total of just five minutes. Add some beers and interesting conversation, and it should be a night to remember!

The main attraction, however, is YOU! If you've made *anything* on the web that has a sustainability aspect, let's hear about it! Whether you want to talk about an old project, or a new idea that's still written on a beermat, this is your opportunity to show off to and inspire a roomful of like-minded people. 

If you want to present (and we hope you do), then let us know when you [RSVP on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/72550332/) and, if you want, add yourself as a speaker on the [Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2012/ignite-cleanweb/).
