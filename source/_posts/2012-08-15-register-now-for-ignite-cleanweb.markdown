It's only a month until <a href='/ignite.html'>Ignite Cleanweb</a> hits London!

We've got 12 great talks lined up for you, covering the whole range of cleanweb activity in the UK. Learn how <a href='http://loco2.com'>Loco2</a> and <a href='http://whipcar.com'>WhipCar</a> are using the web to change the face of travel, or, if you fancy something more technical, how to write climate-friendly code and run it in a climate-friendly datacentre.

It's happening the evening of Thursday 13th September, at <a href='http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/venue'>Forward Technology</a> in Camden. With great talks,
good conversation, and a few beers thrown in, it should be a night to remember.

Places are limited, so <a href='http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/72550332/'>register now</a> to make sure you don't miss out!
