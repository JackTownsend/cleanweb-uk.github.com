  We are putting together a Manifesto for the Cleanweb movement. Because this is something we want to community to get on board 
  with, we want your comments and input. You can join the discussion on our 
  <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oTJ1IExuLGxUDTkYNm9nUm9DSi2gsfpl23FQzMkDGkQ/edit'>Google doc</a>.

  This is the current draft version, open for discussion.

  <h1>The Cleanweb Manifesto</h1>

  <h2>Given:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>We are hitting the natural limits of our planet;</li>
    <li>We need to reduce the impact of our species immediately or face widespread systemic failure;</li>
    <li>As programmers, we are trained for a high-tech society, not a collapsed low-tech one;</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>If:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>We want to preserve a society compatible with our lifestyle and interests, and in which we are useful,</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Then:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>We must use our skills to help bring about an orderly transition to a more sustainable society;</li>
    <li>And we must do it <strong>NOW</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
