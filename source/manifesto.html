  <p>
    We know that as a species, we are hitting the limits, in resources, pollution, 
    and our impact on the natural world. We know that exponential growth in a closed 
    system is dangerous. We know that we must reduce the impact of our society 
    immediately or face widespread systemic failure.
  </p>
  <p>
    As makers and entrepreneurs, our task is to make these constraints work for us, and 
    use our creativity to deliver progress without the costs we previously accepted as
    a side effect of our work.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have very little time, but we have an incredibly powerful tool at our disposal. We 
    have to apply the power of the web to make change happen at all levels of society, 
    transforming businesses, governments, and citizens on a massive scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beginning today, we will dedicate ourselves to this mission. We will work on projects
    with true meaning, that make the future a better place to be, rather than creating 
    illusory short-term value.
  </p>
  <p>
    We hope you will join us. We have a lot of work to do.
