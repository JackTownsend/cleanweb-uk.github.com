__GIVEN:__

* We are hitting the natural limits of our planet;
* We need to reduce the impact of our species immediately or face widespread systemic failure;
* As programmers, we are trained for a high-tech society, not a collapsed low-tech one;

__IF:__

* We want to preserve a society compatible with our lifestyle and interests, and in which we are useful,

__THEN:__

* We must use our skills to help bring about an orderly transition to a more sustainable society;
* And we must do it __NOW__.
