We are **Cleanweb UK**, a group dedicated to raising the profile of cleanweb efforts in the UK.

> Cleanweb (noun): software development, particularly web-based, which aims to make a more sustainable society

We have a big problem to solve, and the web is the fastest-moving tool we have. Whether you're building
energy monitoring systems, helping people network around local food, or making the web itself greener,
if you're developing online tools for sustainability, you're part of the cleanweb. Glad to have you on 
board!

If you're part of the cleanweb and want help, information, or just the knowledge that there's someone else
out there, **Cleanweb UK** is for you.
