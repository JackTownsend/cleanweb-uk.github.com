After many of you braved ice and snow our last events selling out our last venue, we've defintely got a treat for you this month.

### When and where

The second cleanweb UK meetup of 2013 is taking place on __25th Feb__, at [Forward Technology's lovely event space][forward].

After leading with a talk about Building Sustainable Cities from Honest Buildings, we're opening up the floor to the community, for a series of lighting talks.

### New to lightning talks?

For those new to the format, lightning talks are simply short talks, designed for ease of participation. 

If you're working on an interesting project, or found something cleanwebby and worth sharing, and you can fit into 5 minutes, then here's your chance to share it with a community of liked minded people.

#### Extra perks this month

Also, because Forward are such wonderful, wonderful people, not only are they opening up their bar to us, and providing the pizza - all gratis, but they'll also be helping us livestream the talks, and record them to put up here. Huzzah!
