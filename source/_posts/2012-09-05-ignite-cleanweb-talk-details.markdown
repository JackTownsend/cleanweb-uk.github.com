Just 8 days to go until <a href='/ignite.html'>Ignite Cleanweb</a> comes to London!

We've nearly finalised the list of talks, and have put the titles and speakers up on our <a href='/ignite.html'>Ignite</a> page.

So, come along to <a href='http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/venue'>Forward Technology</a> on Thursday 13th September, and learn how <a href='http://loco2.com'>Loco2</a> took on <em>the European Rail Booking Monster</em>, or maybe how to live <em>Offgrid in the City</em>. How about <em>Good Food, For Everyone, Forever</em>, courtesy of <a href='http://sustaination.co'>Sustaination</a>, or <em>how open hardware can help save energy</em> with <a href='http://openenergymonitor.org/'>OpenEnergyMonitor</a>?

Places are limited, so <a href='http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/72550332/'>register now</a> to make sure you don't miss out! If you can't make it, we'll be streaming live video and posting the talks online afterwards, so you don't have to miss out.

Also, if you're an organisation and would like to buy the beers in the pub afterwards, please <a href='mailto:info@cleanweb.org.uk?subject=Ignite Beers'>get in touch</a>!
