It's the start of a new year, which can only mean one thing new meetup for the new month!

For our first meet up of the year on __Monday 21st Jan__, we'll be looking into the terribly trendy world of Open data, fitting enough, at swanky offices of the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/).

We'll be covering how open data is being used around the world, with speakers from academia, government and startups giving a series of short (15 mins each) talks, showing how people are using it to fight climate change.
 
### Speakers:

* __[Jack Townsend, University of Southhampton](http://www.jacktownsend.net)__: Open sustainability: can opening up knowledge save the planet?

* __[Seb Junemann & Jamie Young, Homely](http://wearehomely.com)__: Using open data to stimulate energy-efficient behaviour

* __[Tom Chance, Greater London Authority](http://www.london.gov.uk/)__: Two years of open environmental data releases

* __[Maya Forstater](http://hiyamaya.wordpress.com/)__: Doing the sustainability math: can open data help us work out 9 billion divided by 1?

__Doors open at 6:30pm, and our first talk begins promptly at 7pm__.

After the talks are finished, we'll be holding a few minutes Q & A 
for the speakers, before heading out by 9pm to continuing the conversation outside the ODI, in [The Fox pub](http://www.thefoxpublichouse.co.uk).

Places are limited but free, and you do need to RVSP, so if this sounds interesting to you, [sign up now on our meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/92321742/)!
