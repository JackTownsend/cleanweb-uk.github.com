It's soon time for Cleanweb London's monthly meeting, and this month we're trying something a little different. After the success of our [Ignite Cleanweb](/ignite.html) event in September, we've decided to try putting on more talks.

So, we're excited to announce our first talk night on 19th November, 7pm at the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/). We've got three great speakers lined up who are going to talk about cloud computing and its environmental impact:

* __Francine Bennett, [Mastodon C](http://mastodonc.com)__: Reducing the environmental impact of big data.
* __Nigel Stevens, [Infinity SDC](infinitysdc.net)__: Creating environmentally-friendly datacentres.
* __Andy Piper, [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/uk/)__: Cloudfoundry, the open source cloud computing platform

Talks will be finished by 9, so we'll be heading to a nearby pub for a drink and a chat afterwards.

Places are limited, so [sign up now](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/83832832/) to avoid disappointment!
