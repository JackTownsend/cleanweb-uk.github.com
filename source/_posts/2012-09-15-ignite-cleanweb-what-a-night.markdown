On Thursday 13th September, we ran our first ever Ignite Cleanweb event, at a fantastic venue  generously provided by the lovely people at Forward.

And to put not too fine a point on it, it seems to have went far better than we dared hope - we wanted to showcase some of the best work happening at the intersection between sustainability and the web, and we had a clutch of speakers doing just that, showing how they were using the web to rethink mobility, mapping, and energy, food and supply chains to name a few of the talks on the night.

But don't just take my word for it - we already [have enough people saying nice things about the night](http://www.meetup.com/Cleanweb-London/events/72550332/) on the internet for us to feel pretty damn chuffed about the night already. 

In particular, [Ed Dowding (disclosure - one of the speakers on the night)](http://sustaination.co/2012/09/cleanweb-the-power-of-software-to-save-the-world/#) actually beat us to this post by a full day, and managed to say write something following the announcement of the Cleanweb Manifesto that we couldn't help but quote here about the night:

> Itâ€™s quite brilliant that the internet has come along just at the right time (albeit very much at the 11th hour). It is open, abundant, distributed. It mocks time and space. It brings people together to share and learn and change. It inspires, motivates, and empowers. It makes doing better easier. Of course it does not have all the solutions, but it mediates and sets the tone for many of them.

> We are proud to be a part of it.

> The presentations were also truly, deeply, brilliantly, emotionally, practically, socially inspiring.

If you missed the event, or if you just fancy watching the talks again, James is currently slicing up the recordings of the talks to put online and to drop into this post - once they're up, we'll add the videos on to this page.
